<p>The Magic system is made of Magic Spells and Magic Users which have their&nbsp;inner mana and a mana reserve.</p>

<p>The general idea behind the system is that Magic Users have limited mana that doesn&#39;t regenerate so they must use their reserve&nbsp;instead. The reserve&nbsp;can be refilled by&nbsp;consumables or a fill reserve effect.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;reserve will always be used instead of mana, meaning that player should fill its reserve and only use their limited mana for emergencies.</p>

<p>The reserve will also drain on its own over time so it can&#39;t be expected to be full if ambushed.</p>

<p>Many Magic Users should be able to work together to pool their mana to create more ressource intensive Magic Spells.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When a Magic Spell is being cast, the Magic User will transfer mana to the Spell&#39;s channeled mana and when the Spell has enough mana and meet all other requirements, it will be activated.</p>

<p>Likewise when a Spell chain is create, mana need to be transfered from the creator to the following spells.</p>

<p>For example, a fireball can create more fireballs with a chain but it will need to transfer the mana it received when created to the fireballs it wants to create.</p>
