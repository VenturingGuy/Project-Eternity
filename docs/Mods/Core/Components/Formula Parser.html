<p>The Formula Parser will read an input and try to parse to compare values. The Core Formula Parser will parse data but can&#39;t interpret data on its own. The data acquisition must be implemented by another component such as the&nbsp;<a href="http://project-eternity-website.nanoapp.io/DisplayPage.php?PagePath=Deathmatch/Code/Formula Parser.html">Deathmatch Formula Parser</a>.</p>

<p>The Core Formula Parser handle all mathematical operation such as divisions, multiplications, modulos, addtions and subtractions and handle all comparaisons such as &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, ==, !=, &amp;&amp; and&nbsp;||.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the input starts with&nbsp;//C# then the input will be considered as C# code and the Roslyn compiler will be used.</p>
