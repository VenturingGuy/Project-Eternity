<h1>Gameplay</h1>

<p>The World&nbsp;mod is a Turn-based strategy game with multiple players building and upgrading their base while capturing&nbsp;Zones to help their progression. Each Player has ressources they can use to construct Buildings or build new Units.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Zones</h1>

<p>A Zone is defined by&nbsp;a group of tiles. When a Player has enough Units in a Zone, it will capture it if it not owned or if the current owner no longer have the minimum number of&nbsp;Units to control this Zone. Once captured, a Zone will allow its owner to construct Buildings on its tiles and will give ressources to its owner at the end of the turn.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Unit Actions</h1>

<p>There are 3 types of Unit, normal Unit, harvest Unit or transport Unit. The normal Unit doesn&#39;t&nbsp;any special ability but will have higher&nbsp;stats than the other 2 types and is more suited for battle. The harvest Unit is the only type that can harvest ressources from ressources spots. The transport Unit can transport other Units, if it is destroyed while transporting Units, they will also be destroyed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Buildings</h1>

<p>Buildings of multiple sizes and uses can be constructed by using ressources. The more advanced a Building is, the more turns it will take to finish its construction. Some buildings are neutral all will be usable as long as there is a Unit inside it. There are 3 main types of Buildings, factories, support Buildings&nbsp;and defense Buildings.</p>

<p>A factory can use ressources to build new Units.</p>

<p>A support Building has a passive role only. Supports Buildings are: Radar, Teleporter, Research Center, Ressource harvester and Power Plant.</p>

<p>A defense building is only used to help in battle. Defense Buildings are: Turret, AA Turret, Wall, Mine and Gravity trap.</p>
