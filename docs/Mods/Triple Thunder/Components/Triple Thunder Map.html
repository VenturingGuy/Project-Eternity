<h1>Gameplay</h1>

<p>The Triple Thunder mod is a 2D beat em/shooter&nbsp;up based on Guardian Heroes 3 layers fighting zones.</p>

<p>As a 2D beat em up, every attacks are&nbsp;based on combos that execute animations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Units Features</h1>

<p>Each Unit as a maximum of 10 Hit Point. Their power is based on their remaining HP, a Unit with 1 HP will only do 10% of what it would do at 10 HP.</p>

<p>When a Unit moves, it consume Gaz, if it run out of Gaz it won&#39;t be able to move until resupplied. If the Unit is flying or on water when it run out of Gaz, it will be destroyed.</p>

<p>A Unit can have up to 2 weapons, the first weapon requires ammunition. Each attack with the first weapon will consume one unit ammunition. If the first weapon can&#39;t be used then the second one will be used instead if it exists. The second weapon does not use&nbsp;ammunition. Just like with Gaz, the first weapon&nbsp;ammunition can be resupplied.</p>

<p>During an attack, if the enemy&nbsp;Unit is in range of attacking with one of its weapon, it will automatically counter-attack. The strength of the counter-attack is based on the HP the Unit has after getting attacked. Some weapons can not be used after moving and some can not be countered.</p>
