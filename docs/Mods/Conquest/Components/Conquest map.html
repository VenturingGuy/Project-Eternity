<h1>Gameplay</h1>

<p>The Conquest&nbsp;mod is a Turn-based strategy game with multiple players fighting and deploying Units&nbsp;until only one player remains.</p>

<p>There are two ways to defeat an enemy player, either eliminate all their units or capture their Headquarters</p>

<p>Each player has a Commanding Officer and a Headquarters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Units Features</h1>

<p>Each Unit as a maximum of 10 Hit Point. Their power is based on their remaining HP, a Unit with 1 HP will only do 10% of what it would do at 10 HP.</p>

<p>When a Unit moves, it consume Gaz, if it run out of Gaz it won&#39;t be able to move until resupplied. If the Unit is flying or on water when it run out of Gaz, it will be destroyed.</p>

<p>A Unit can have up to 2 weapons, the first weapon requires ammunition. Each attack with the first weapon will consume one unit ammunition. If the first weapon can&#39;t be used then the second one will be used instead if it exists. The second weapon does not use&nbsp;ammunition. Just like with Gaz, the first weapon&nbsp;ammunition can be resupplied.</p>

<p>During an attack, if the enemy&nbsp;Unit is in range of attacking with one of its weapon, it will automatically counter-attack. The strength of the counter-attack is based on the HP the Unit has after getting attacked. Some weapons can not be used after moving and some can not be countered.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Unit Actions</h1>

<p>The first time a Unit is selected in a turn, it will either allow the player to move it and show where it can be moved or open a menu to show different actions. For instance, if a Unit can attack, instead of being able to move direcly, the men will open and ask if the Unit will move or attack.</p>

<p>After a Unit has move, the menu will open and ask what its next move will be. If it can attack it will add the attack option and&nbsp;if it was transporting troops it will show the deploy option. The final option will be Wait, which will finish the Unit action and prevent if from doing something else until the next turn.</p>

<p>Even if&nbsp;a Unit has moved, as long as didn&#39;t do any other action, it can undo the movement and return to its original position, it can be used to test the attack range of the Unit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Buildings</h1>

<p>A building is a tile on the map that can be captured by a player to gain bonuses. Each building has 20 HP and will be captured when its HP reach 0.</p>

<p>To capture a building, the player need to place a foot soldier on a tile with a building and select Capture. Each turn, the building HP will drop by the number of HP the Unit capturing it has. This mean a&nbsp;Unit with its maximum HP&nbsp;will take 2 turns to capture the building.</p>

<p>Each turn, a&nbsp;captured building will give money to its owner based on the settings of the map.</p>
